## Git
 One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.

## Why Use SSH Key
Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. You can also use an SSH key to sign commits

## WakaTime  
The WakaTime Chrome extension is open source on GitHub. The Chrome extension shows the time you spend reading documentation, debugging a web app, and other browser based activity.
